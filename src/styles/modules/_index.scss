/*
* _index processes all the partials in this folder, and allows
* the folder's contents to be passed/forwarded to other partials
* Sass 2.0 requires $var as local vars, not global

* To import the contents of the base folder use a namespace or *
* If appropriate (fear of var similarly named) use a letter, eg, b
* @use "../base" as b; 
* This would mean calling the folder would be b.card

* @use "../base" as *;
* Where * is everything. 
* * means that no namespace (eg, b) is needed
